# MultiHeaded_Classification_CNN
Multi-headed image classification using CNN on the Deep Fashion dataset

# Dataset
'FashionDataset' directory contains all the necessary data for training the model. The 'FashionDataset.zip' file can be used as backup.

# Execution
1) Please setup your conda environment with the necessary SDKs are captured below:
 	- PyTorch
 	- Matplotlib
 	- Pandas
 	- NumPy

2) Continue to open 'BasicFashionModel.ipynb' on your Jupyter Notebook (or any compatible IDE)
 	- You may also use the Python script for personal preference

3) Run the script with CUDA (default) if you have GPU available to train the model

NOTE: Training may take Several minutes to few hours depending on the model parameters and hardware used
