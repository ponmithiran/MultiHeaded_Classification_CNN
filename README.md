# MultiHeaded_Classification_CNN
Multi-headed image classification using CNN on the Deep Fashion dataset

# Dataset
Please download and unzip the FashionDataset.zip onto your working directory

# Execution
Please setup your conda environment with the necessary SDKs are captured below:
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

Continue to open 'BasicFashionModel.ipynb' on your Jupyter Notebook (or any compatible IDE)

Run the script without CUDA enabled for CPU execution (or with CUDA if you have GPU available) to train the model

NOTE: Training may take Several minutes to few hours depending on the model parameters and hardware used
